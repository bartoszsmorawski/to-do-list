##   General description:
This page was created as homework to practice creating lists in **Java Script**.
  
With this list, you can easily make a to-do list. In any way, you can add, **cross out the actions performed** or **remove them completely**.



##   Technologies used:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- BEM convention
- Normalize
- GIT
- Flex


## Folders:

  The files include folders such as : **css, js, images** and **index.html**.

## CSS:

This folder is divided into **3 files** : **container.css, list.css, style.css**. Each of them steels individual elements on the page.

## JavaScript:

In this folder is the **script.js** file which contains the **algorithm**. This algorithm makes the buttons on the page make changes, such as **deleting** , **crossing out** , or **adding** text.
